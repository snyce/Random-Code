A place to put random code that is not project related. It took me a while to get it sorted and to find some of it, but here it is.

*NOTE: I work with most of my stuff on Bitbucket, so this is always lagging behind and a bit outdated.

~~~~
C - cause roots (really really really old C stuff, doesn't work).
nodjs - cause shiny (playing with JS and node).
perl - cause why not (well TMTOWTDI).
python - cause RAWR!
ruby - cause config managment yo.
shell - cause I can.

And there you have it.
