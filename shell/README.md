Here are a few goofy scripts I've created in shell.

check_hosts.sh - this was a check for minimum requirments on a host.
gpw.sh - this is to generate X number of Y lenght "random" passwords.
lsdir.sh - this is to check if dir is empty (multiple)
macnorm.sh - this is to normalize mac addresses for DHCP.
pushit.sh - this is my general purpose add, commit and push to github.
pwgen.sh - like gpw just single.
test_for_loop.sh - first for loop in bash, hadn't needed them until now.
