Just some old python stuff that, add more soon(ish) all of the netapp stuff is waaaaay old and probably doesn't work.
~~~~
aggr.py - used to get aggregate information on a netapp (way old)
disk_usage.py - playing with pdfs.
get_ip.py - get ips from a log file, not the prettiest but works in a pinch.
iops.py - get iops info from netapp.
keys.py - baby version of walk.py
lic.py - get license information from netapp
newFTPAcct.py - something I wrote when I had to manage FTP accounts.
perf_tools.py - netapp performance tools.
qtree.py - get qtree information from netapp
walk.py - walk a directory and alternatively remove duplicate (md5sum) files
